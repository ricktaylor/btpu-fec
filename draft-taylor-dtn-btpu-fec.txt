1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Forward Error Correction

   To reduce the overhead associated with repeating Messages, the
   protocol supports the use of forward error correction, by emitting
   Transfer Repair Messages (Section 2.2) containing information that
   can be used to recover lost Messages.

   Every Transfer Message includes an unsigned 8-bit FEC Instance ID
   field.  The value of this field indicates the FEC scheme and
   parameters to be used to recover missing parts of the Bundle, and the
   mapping from FEC Instance ID to the associated scheme and parameters
   MUST be pre-agreed at both sender and receiver using an out of band
   mechanism.  FEC Instance ID zero (0) indicates that no FEC mechanism
   is in use for the Transfer.

   The FEC Instance ID MUST be the same for all Messages concerned with
   an individual Transfer, i.e. the FEC scheme in use MUST NOT change
   mid-transfer.  If a receiver detects a change in FEC Instance ID
   during a Transfer, it MUST consider the Transfer cancelled, and
   ignore all future Messages associated with the Transfer.

2.1.1.  Mapping to RFC 6363

   For all non-zero values of FEC Instance ID, the protocol follows the
   framework defined in [RFC6363], mapping the concepts defined in
   Section 2 of [RFC6363] to this protocol in the following manner:

   Application Data Unit (ADU):  In this protocol a Bundle is the ADU.

   ADU Flow:  This protocol considers all communication between a sender
      and receiver as a single ADU Flow, as the link-layer protocol is
      expected to be point-to-point in nature.

   Application Protocol:  This protocol.

   Content Delivery Protocol (CDP):  This protocol is considered a CDP.

   FEC Framework Configuration Information:  This protocol requires FEC
      framework configuration information to be delivered via some out-
      of-band mechanism or a-priori configuration.

   FEC Repair Packet:  The Transfer Repair Message (Section 2.2) acts as
      the corresponding FEC Repair Packet.

   FEC Source Packet:  The Transfer Segment Message and Transfer End
      Message act as the corresponding FEC Source Packet.

   Repair Flow:  The series of Transfer Repair Messages act as the
      Repair Flow.

   Repair FEC Payload ID:  See Repair FEC Payload ID (Section 2.1.3).

   Source Flow:  The series of Transfer Segment and Transfer End
      Messages act as the Source Flow.

   Source FEC Payload ID:  The combination of FEC Instance ID, Transfer
      Number, and Segment Sequence Number provide suitable Source FEC
      Payload ID.

   Transport Protocol:  The underlying link-layer protocol.

   Other definitions in RFC 6363 remain as defined in that document.

2.1.2.  FEC Instance ID

   TODO - Stuff!

2.1.3.  Repair FEC Payload ID

   The combination of FEC Instance ID and Transfer Number provide a part
   of the Repair FEC Payload ID, but additional information is expected
   to be required in Transfer Repair Messages, depending on the FEC
   scheme in use.

2.2.  Transfer Repair Message

   The Transfer Repair Message is used to carry repair information when
   Forward Error Correction is in use, see Section 2.1.  This message
   corresponds to the "Repair Packet" in Section 5.1 of [RFC6363].

   A Transfer Repair Message has a type of TBD.  The Message Content
   field is formatted as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Transfer Number                               | FEC Inst. ID  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                ... Repair FEC Payload ID ...                  :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                 ... Segment Repair Data ...                   :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Transfer Number:  The numeric identifier of the in-progress Transfer
      that this Segment is part of, encoded as a 24-bit unsigned integer
      in network byte order.

   FEC Instance ID:  The identifier of the FEC scheme and parameters in
      use for this Transfer, see Forward Error Correction (Section 2.1).

   Repair FEC Payload ID:  See Repair FEC Payload ID (Section 2.1.3).

   Segment Repair Data:  The octets of the repair data for a Segment of
      the Transfer, with the length calculated as the Message content
      length excluding the 12 octets of the Transfer Number, FEC
      Instance, Segment Sequence Number, and Segment Data Length.

   Transfer Repair Messages SHOULD NOT have zero octets of Segment
   Repair Data, i.e. the total length of the Message SHOULD be greater
   than 16 octets.  Such Messages only add control-plane overhead and
   SHOULD NOT be used as an alternative form of padding.

   Transfer Repair Messages With FEC Instance ID zero (0) are not valid.
   They SHOULD NOT be emitted by a sender and MUST be ignored by a
   receiver.
