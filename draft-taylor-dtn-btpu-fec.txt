       Forward Error Correction for the Bundle Transfer Protocol
                    draft-taylor-dtn-btpu-fec-latest

Abstract

   This document defines an optional extension to the Bundle Transfer
   Protocol - Unidirectional, as described in [BTPU], to enable forward
   error correction (FEC) coding to be applied selectively to the
   transfer of individual bundles on a case by case basis.

   The definition and use of FEC follows the FECFRAME framework defined
   in [RFC6363], and this document introduces new Message types to BTPU
   in order to carry the FEC information as defined in the framework.

1.  Introduction

   There are a number of use-cases of the Bundle Transfer Protocol -
   Unidirectional [BTPU], where the use of transfer segment repetition
   as a mechanism to protect against the loss of frames can be
   considered sub-optimal.  This document describes an alternate
   mechanism based on forward error correction (FEC) coding, that
   requires increased computational complexity but fewer transmitted
   bits.  Rather than defining novel formats and registries for the
   variety of standardized FEC mechanisms, this document reuses the
   primitives and best practices of the FECFRAME framework, defined in
   [RFC6363].

   Just as in core BTPU, a Bundle is split in a series of octet
   sequences that are emitted into frames by the sender to be
   transported to receivers by the underlying link-layer protocol; but
   when FEC is desired, the mechanisms defined in the FECFRAME framework
   are used to produce a sequence of Source Blocks and Repair Symbols
   that are placed into new Messages, rather than just sub-slices of the
   original Bundle.  The new Messages are used to distinguish FEC Source
   Blocks and FEC Repair Symbols from core BTPU Segments.

   Although the content and processing of the new Messages differs from
   existing BTPU Messages, the rules around the emission and replication
   of the Messages are identical to the rules applicable to the core
   BTPU Segment Messages, and they follow the common BTPU Message
   format, allowing implementations that do not support this extension
   to efficiently detect and ignore the new Messages.

1.1.  Applicability

   It should be noted that when FEC is available at the link-layer it is
   generally more effective than applying it at the Transfer layer, and
   should probably be used when it is available.  This extension is
   designed to provide FEC capabilities when the underlying link-layer
   protocol does not have native support for FEC, or when per-Transfer
   FEC is desired by a deployment.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol Overview

   Rather than updating the Segment Messages defined in BTPU, this
   extension introduces two new pairs of Messages to carry the source
   and repair symbols of a BTPU Bundle protected with FEC.  The use of
   new types allows a deployment to select the use of FEC as appropriate
   on a per-transfer basis, perhaps associated with some upper layer
   concept of reliability for a particular transfer, or change in
   transmission environment.  In the language of Section 2 of [RFC6363],
   the FEC Source Messages act as FEC Source Packets, and the FEC Repair
   Messages as FEC Repair Packets.  Within the context of a particular
   Transfer, the sequence of FEC Source Messages are considered the
   Source Flow, and the sequence of FEC Repair Messages the Repair Flow.

   The source and repair Messages are grouped into two pairs:

   Pre-agreed FEC:  The Pre-agreed FEC Source (Section 4.1) and
      Pre-agreed FEC Repair (Section 4.3) Messages provide a wire-
      efficient format, for use when the FEC Framework Configuration
      Information Section 5.5 of [RFC6363] has been pre-agreed via some
      a-priori configuration or out-of-band mechanism.

   Explicit FEC:  The Explicit FEC Source (Section 4.2) and Explicit FEC
      Repair (Section 4.4) Messages include the FEC-Scheme-Specific
      Information (FSSI) in the Message content, allowing for the ad-hoc
      use of different FEC schemes and configuration, given underlying
      implementation support.

   Irrespective of whether Pre-agreed or Explicit FEC is in use for a
   Transfer, the FEC Framework Configuration Information MUST NOT change
   mid-transfer.  If a receiver detects a change in FEC Framework
   Configuration Information during a Transfer, it MUST consider any
   incomplete Transfer affected by the change as cancelled, and ignore
   all future Messages associated with the Transfer.

3.1.  Pre-agreed FEC Instance ID

   TODO - Stuff!

   Every Transfer Message includes an unsigned 8-bit FEC Instance ID
   field.  The value of this field indicates the FEC scheme and
   parameters to be used to recover missing parts of the Bundle, and the
   mapping from FEC Instance ID to the associated scheme and parameters
   MUST be pre-agreed at both sender and receiver using an out of band
   mechanism.  FEC Instance ID zero (0) indicates that no FEC mechanism
   is in use for the Transfer.

   The FEC Instance ID MUST be the same for all Messages concerned with
   an individual Transfer, i.e. the FEC scheme in use MUST NOT change
   mid-transfer.  If a receiver detects a change in FEC Instance ID
   during a Transfer, it MUST consider the Transfer cancelled, and
   ignore all future Messages associated with the Transfer.

4.  Message Definitions

   All new Messages introduced in this document follow the common
   message format as defined in Section 4 of [BTPU].

   This specification deviates from the recommendation in Section 5.3 of
   [RFC6363] by placing the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID before the
   Source Data, as BTPU has no capability analogous to common header
   compression, as found in Robust Header Compression (ROHC) [RFC3095],
   and therefore to maintain consistency with other BTPU messages, the
   metadata precedes the data.

4.1.  Pre-agreed FEC Source Message

   Block (Section 2 of [RFC6363]) of a Bundle Transfer that uses FEC
